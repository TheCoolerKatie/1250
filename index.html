  <h1>Written Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>	I would argue that Windows 10 (but absolutely not Windows 8) is a very well designed piece of software. While the “windows” in the operating system are not exclusive to this operating system, Windows 10 allows programs to run with a convenient visual interface. This visual interface allows the probably human users to utilise their primary sense, being sight, instead of visualising images in their head given a terminal. The terminal itself also has  improvements over other operating systems, both having intuitive commands and also ANSII escape codes, allowing the appearance of text to be customised in-terminal. It’s even possible to load entire images in full colour within the terminal with the support these provide, even if it may not be very fast or practical. Speaking of customization, Windows 10 redesigned its settings menu, allowing fast changes of just about anything on the computer. Of course, not only is the older settings menu still present if required, but there are also commands such as the community-named “GodMode” folder that allows access to any and all options menus on the device. Windows 10 combines modern easy-to-use design without the commonplace restrictions to stop users from modifying the operating system itself, which is why I think it is an example of relatively modern, well-designed software.

  <p>	As to why software design is important, it’s rather simple. Users need to be able to actually use the software itself. I mean, what’s the point of going through all the effort to install a door in a wall only for it to be locked from both sides at all times with no way to unlock it? The door might as well just be a decoration on the original wall, and all the effort is meaningless. People create software to accomplish a purpose, and even if a piece of software isn’t often meant to be touched by the average user, like a modern BIOS; the easier a human operator can use it, the easier the software can usually accomplish that purpose. Even if the aspects of the design are purely cosmetic, less practical bells and whistles, if they make a user more likely to want to use that software, then the software has more opportunities to achieve its purpose. Even if a piece of software is intentionally a horrible experience to use, as long as it fulfils its purpose, such as being funny to the designer, it may be well designed. At the end of the day, software design’s importance is rather subjective, and it can mean anything to anyone. What software design does do, though, is allow software to accomplish its purpose, whatever that purpose might be.
